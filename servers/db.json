      "bodyPost": "Drive around Jamaica and you’ll whizz by food stalls at the roadside, small stands with fish roasting on grill grates and stock pots brimming with soup roiling over open flames. If you're on one of these drives, and if your eyes catch a vendor with small clear bags stuffed with bright red shrimp, you should slow down and try some.",

      "bodyPost": "Now that it's colder outside, we find ourselves gravitating toward heavier dishes at the end of the day. But it doesn't have to be this way. While many salads may not fill a cold-weather comfort-food void, there is one that can: the Niçoise. For this recipe, we gather the traditional ingredients for the salad with a few twists. The first and most important: We use canned wild Alaska salmon. It's a fresh take on a satisfying dish that will deliver healthy ingredients amidst a decadent holiday season.",

On a different visit to Madrid years before around Easter time, I had enjoyed more straightforward versions of torrijas at the aptly named La Casa de las Torrijas, where they serve snack-sized portions of milk- and sweet wine–soaked torrijas.",
